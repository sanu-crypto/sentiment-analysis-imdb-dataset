🎬 Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Reviews
📌 Overview

This project performs sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset of 50,000 movie reviews, classifying them as positive or negative.
We compare three approaches:

Logistic Regression (TF-IDF)

⚙️ Steps

Data Preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization).

Feature Extraction (TF-IDF, Embeddings, BERT Tokenizer).

Model Training (Logistic Regression, LSTM, BERT).

Evaluation (Accuracy, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, Word Clouds).

📊 Results

Logistic Regression → ~89%

BERT → ~93%

👉 Insight: BERT gives the best performance since it understands context and sarcasm better than traditional methods
